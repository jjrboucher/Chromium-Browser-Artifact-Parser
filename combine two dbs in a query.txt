To query across two SQLite files in Python using Pandas, you typically need to combine the data from these files into a single DataFrame. This is because SQLite doesn't natively support querying across multiple databases in a single query. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:

Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have Pandas and SQLite installed. You can install Pandas with pip if you haven’t already:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Read Data from Each SQLite File: Use Pandas to read data from each SQLite database into separate DataFrames.

Combine DataFrames: Once you have the data in DataFrames, you can perform operations like merging, concatenating, or joining them.

Here’s a code example that demonstrates this process:


import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Connect to the first SQLite database
conn1 = sqlite3.connect('database1.sqlite')
query1 = 'SELECT * FROM table1'  # Replace with your actual query
df1 = pd.read_sql_query(query1, conn1)

# Connect to the second SQLite database
conn2 = sqlite3.connect('database2.sqlite')
query2 = 'SELECT * FROM table2'  # Replace with your actual query
df2 = pd.read_sql_query(query2, conn2)

# Optionally, close the connections
conn1.close()
conn2.close()

# Combine DataFrames (Example: concatenation, merge, etc.)
# This example assumes you want to concatenate them
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# If you need to merge them based on a common column
# combined_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column')

# Show combined DataFrame
print(combined_df)



Steps Explained:
Connect to Databases: You create connections to both SQLite databases using sqlite3.connect.

Read Data: Use pd.read_sql_query to execute SQL queries and load the results into DataFrames.

Combine DataFrames: Depending on your needs, you can use pd.concat to concatenate DataFrames or pd.merge to perform SQL-like joins.

Close Connections: It’s good practice to close your database connections once you’re done.

Notes:
Adjust the SQL queries (query1, query2) to fit your actual use case.
Ensure that if you are concatenating DataFrames, they have compatible structures (i.e., similar columns). If merging, ensure that the columns you are merging on are present in both DataFrames.
